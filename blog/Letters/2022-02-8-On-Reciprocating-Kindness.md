## Dear Reader,

I'm happy that you're sharing your story with me. It seems like the majority of people are feeling a bit sad these days. COVID hinders people from seeing there families, it disrupts the natural support mechanisms people have in their lives.

It seems like the cop that let you off with a warning did a good thing. I'm happy that you understand that he was doing his job, and that we need those reminders from our regular routine to pay attention. It's for our own good.

I'm also happy that you want to reciprocate his kindness. 

In life we are limited to making so many decisions a day. We build purpose from our life by the impact that we have. 

I understand that you want to go back and give him his kindness back. Give him a gift because you appreciate what he did.

Never mind the legal implications of this, lets focus on the potential good his one decision could have on the world.

On the one hand cops these days have a tough time. The media sentiment against them is bad, and they need to enforce unpleasant things. Giving a gift to him will make him happy. His happiness may carry forward to making others happy, but still he is limited to his own decisions.

On that scenario you've made one person happy from his one decision to make you happy.

What if you take the feelings you have and place them on another in need. It's difficult to tell when you will have the opportunity to do so, but when you do you can pass his kindness forward.

If you have the opportunity to pass the kindness forward, let them know why you are doing so, and if possible ask if they can too pass it forward.

We all start good natured, have that in us, and a little nudge goes a long way.

On this scenario that one cops actions could make a lot of people happy.

You are giving his life quite a bit more purpose, and an after effect is making a lot of other people happy.

Wouldn't you want to live in a world where when people have the opportunity to choose kindness, they will?
