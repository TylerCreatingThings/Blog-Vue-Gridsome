I'm Tyler Farkas, I live in Toronto, Canada. I'm a coder, and I write letters. I like to do all sorts of experiments with my life. Like to learn many different things. I've been told that I'm a good teacher, and can simplify complex topics. Thats because I give and do practical things instead of telling you to just do. Thats what I plan to do in this blog, by writing easily digestible content with no "fluff" to help people advance their careers, and lives. I'm by no means an expert in either, but I'll share what I found works for me!
